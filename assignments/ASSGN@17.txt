      Constraining the Values of your data.
1) Create the Orders table so that all onum values as well as all combinations of
cnum and snum are different from one another, and so that NULL values are
excluded from the date field.
ANS->CREATE TABLE orders1 
( 
onum number(4), 
cnum number(4),
 sname number(4), 
odate date NOT NULL,
 CONSTRAINT p_k_1 PRIMARY key(onum,cnum,sname)
 );

2) Create the Salespeople table so that the default commission is 10% with no
NULLS permitted, snum is the primary key, and all names fall alphabetically
between A and M, inclusive (assume all names will be uppercase).
ANS->CREATE TABLE salespeople1
 (
 comm number(3) DEFAULT 10,
 snum number(4) PRIMARY KEY, 
sname varchar2(10) check(substr(upper(sname),1,1) BETWEEN 'A' AND 'B')
 );
3) Create the Orders table, making sure that the onum is greater than the cnum, and
the cnum is greater that the snum. Allow no NULLS in any of these three fields.
